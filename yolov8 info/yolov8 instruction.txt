1) make a directory in your pc
2) cd to this directory
3) create a virtualenv in this directory 
   py -m venv myyolov8   (myyolov8 is the name of my virtual env)
4) activate this venv :
   myyolov8\Scripts\acivate
5) upgrade pip
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
6) install ultralytics
   pip install ultralytics

7) for running main.py file that i attached to the email, choose the appropriate interpreter: 
   interpretor should be in the directory of virual env that you have already created. it is a python.exe file in Script directory
8) you may need to change the directory of image and model in line 14 (image), 31(onnx model)
9) run the main.py file



Note: there is no need to stride over the image, and do inference on every square images. the inference is done directly on the rectangle image
